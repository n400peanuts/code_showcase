### Instructed and Uninstructed learning routines of new words
These are two distinct learning routines to learn new words based on visual hebbian learning. A volunteer has to learn 50 new meaningless words visually presented on the screen (e.g. 'catampo'). In the uninstructed routine he has to disentagle the new words from random distractors pressing the button 'yes' everytime he thinks that is encountering a word, and 'no' everytime he thinks that instead what he's looking is a distractor. Everytime the guess is correct, he receives a visual feedback that consists in the correct word coloured in green, otherwise in red. At the beginning the behaviour of the volunteer is almost at chance, however in the following blocks he menages to get right the task, remembering his correct choices:
